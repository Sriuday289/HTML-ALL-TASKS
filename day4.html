 <h1>Visual studio code </h1>
 <p1> Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free, lightweight, and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft.
    <br>
    It is designed for editing, debugging, and building applications across various programming languages.
    <br>
    VS Code is highly extensible, supports features like syntax highlighting, IntelliSense (smart code completion), debugging tools, and version control integration, and runs on major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p1>
<br>
Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VS Code, is an integrated development environment developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.
Visual Studio Code is proprietary software released under the "Microsoft Software License", but based on the MIT licensed program named "Visual Studio Code — Open Source" (also known as "Code — OSS"), also created by Microsoft and available through GitHub. Open-source binaries are available from VSCodium, without Microsoft's telemetry.
In the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool among 86,544 respondents, with 73.71% reporting that they use it.
